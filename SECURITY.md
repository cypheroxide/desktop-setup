# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support security updates for the following versions of our desktop setup project:

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                | Development versions - use at your own risk |

**Note**: This project is currently in active development. We recommend always using the latest commit from the `master` branch for the most up-to-date security fixes.

## What Constitutes a Security Vulnerability

In the context of this desktop setup project, security vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:

### Critical Security Issues
- **Credential Exposure**: Hardcoded passwords, API keys, SSH keys, or other sensitive credentials
- **Code Injection**: Shell command injection vulnerabilities in scripts
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unintended sudo/root access or permission bypass
- **Malicious Dependencies**: Compromised packages or repositories being installed

### High Priority Security Issues
- **Insecure Network Configuration**: Unencrypted connections, weak VPN configurations
- **File Permission Issues**: Overly permissive file/directory permissions
- **Container Security**: Docker/container misconfigurations exposing sensitive data
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised upstream packages or installation sources

### Medium Priority Security Issues
- **Information Disclosure**: Unintended exposure of system information or configuration details
- **Weak Cryptography**: Use of deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms
- **Input Validation**: Improper handling of user input in scripts

## Known Security Considerations

This project involves system-level configurations and installations. Please be aware of the following:

### Inherent Risks
- **Root/Sudo Access**: Scripts require elevated privileges for system configuration
- **Package Installation**: Automated installation of packages from AUR and official repositories
- **Configuration Modification**: System-wide changes to shell, networking, and desktop environments
- **Docker Containers**: Deployment of containerized services with network access

### Security Measures Implemented
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Scripts validate user input and environment variables
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with `set -euo pipefail`
- ✅ **Dependency Verification**: Package signature verification where possible
- ✅ **Secure Defaults**: Conservative default configurations
- ✅ **Network Security**: Tailscale VPN integration for secure networking
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated security scanning and validation

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to us immediately.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Primary Method**: Create a private security advisory
- Go to: https://github.com/cypheroxide/desktop-setup/security/advisories/new
- This allows for private disclosure and coordinated response

**Alternative Method**: Email Report
- Email: security@hopeintsys.com
- Include "SECURITY REPORT" in the subject line

**Public Issues**: Only use public issues for non-sensitive security discussions or after coordinated disclosure

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much detail as possible:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Components**: Which scripts, configurations, or processes are affected
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
6. **Environment**: OS version, shell, and other relevant environment details

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of report submission
- **Status Updates**: Every 3 days until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 48 hours, others within 7 days
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

## What to Expect

### Accepted Vulnerabilities
1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt and provide a tracking identifier
2. **Assessment**: We'll evaluate severity using CVSS scoring
3. **Collaboration**: We may reach out for additional details or clarification
4. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you on appropriate disclosure timing
6. **Credit**: You'll be credited in our security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Declined Reports
1. **Explanation**: We'll provide detailed reasoning for declining
2. **Appeal Process**: You may provide additional information if you disagree
3. **Documentation**: We'll document the decision for future reference

Common reasons for declining:
- Issue is by design (e.g., requiring sudo access)
- Insufficient impact or exploitability
- Already known and documented
- Outside the scope of the project

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using this desktop setup project:

### Before Installation
- [ ] Review all scripts before execution
- [ ] Understand what will be installed and configured
- [ ] Backup your current system configuration
- [ ] Run on a test system first if possible

### During Installation
- [ ] Monitor script execution for unexpected behavior
- [ ] Verify network connections are secure (HTTPS/SSH)
- [ ] Check that only expected packages are being installed

### After Installation
- [ ] Review generated configurations
- [ ] Change default passwords if any were set
- [ ] Verify firewall and network security settings
- [ ] Remove any temporary files or credentials

## Additional Security Information

### Code Review Process
- All changes undergo automated security scanning
- Manual review required for security-sensitive modifications
- Third-party security tools integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Cryptographic Standards
- SSH keys: ED25519 or RSA 4096+ bit
- VPN: WireGuard protocol via Tailscale
- Package verification: GPG signature validation where available

### Dependencies and Supply Chain
- Packages sourced from official Arch repositories and trusted AUR
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Chaotic AUR integration follows official security practices

### Network Security
- Tailscale VPN for secure inter-device communication
- Firewall rules configured for minimal attack surface
- Secure container networking configurations
